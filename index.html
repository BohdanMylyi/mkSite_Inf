                    <p class="history-text">
                        Mortal Kombat is an American media franchise centered on a series of fighting video games
                        originally
                        developed by Midway Games in 1992.

                        The original Mortal Kombat arcade game spawned a franchise consisting of action-adventure games,
                        a comic
                        book series, a card game, films, an animated TV series, and a live-action tour. Mortal Kombat
                        has become the
                        best-selling fighting game franchise worldwide and one of the highest-grossing media franchises
                        of all time.

                        The series has a reputation for high levels of graphic violence, including, most notably, its
                        fatalities,
                        which are finishing moves that kill defeated opponents instead of knocking them out.
                        Controversies
                        surrounding Mortal Kombat, in part, led to the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating
                        Board (ESRB)
                        video game rating system. Early games in the series were noted for their realistic digitized
                        sprites and an
                        extensive use of palette swapping to create new characters. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the
                        Mortal Kombat
                        development team was acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment and re-established as NetherRealm
                        Studios.
